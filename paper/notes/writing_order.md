### **1. Experimental Results**
- Start with the results because they are the core of the paper. They directly reflect the success or failure of your theoretical framework and experimental design.
- Writing this first ensures the quantitative and qualitative findings are clear before interpreting them in other sections.
- Key focus: Include all metrics, statistical analyses, and key observations (e.g., ReLU2’s catastrophic failure, Abs2-Neg’s drop, etc.).

---

### **2. Discussion**
- Once the results are clear, interpret them. Tie the findings back to the theoretical framework and hypotheses.
- Address surprises (e.g., Abs2’s unexpected robustness) and propose explanations (e.g., Abs’s folding behavior aligning with distance metrics).
- Explore speculative ideas (e.g., the need for bias in Abs2-Neg) and future work inspired by the results.

---

### **3. Background**
- With results and interpretations in mind, write the background to contextualize the experiments.
- Include the theoretical framework, prior research, and definitions of key concepts (e.g., distance vs. intensity metrics, activation functions, etc.).
- Ensure this section sets up the experimental design logically.

---

### **4. Experimental Design**
- Build on the background to describe the experiments.
- Detail the six models, the role of architectural constraints (activations, Neg, bias removal), and the training protocol.
- Highlight why these choices were made and how they address the research questions.

---

### **5. Introduction**
- Write the introduction once the rest of the paper is nearly complete.
- Use the results and discussion to craft a compelling overview of the impact and significance of your findings.
- Briefly summarize the background, experiments, and conclusions.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
- With the full story now written, summarize the key takeaways, contributions, and implications of your work.
- Highlight broader impacts and future directions.

---

### **7. Prior Work**
- Write this last to ensure it aligns seamlessly with the narrative of the paper.
- Use the rest of the paper to identify which prior research is most relevant and craft a historical context that naturally leads to your work.

---

### Rationale for This Order:
- Starting with results and discussion ensures the data drives the narrative, making the paper more cohesive and grounded.
- Writing the background and experimental design next ensures these sections logically build toward the results.
- Finishing with the introduction, conclusion, and prior work allows you to fine-tune the framing and significance of your work after all other sections are solidified.
