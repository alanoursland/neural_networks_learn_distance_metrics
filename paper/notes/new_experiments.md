These proposed experiments are a fantastic way to test the theories more rigorously and uncover deeper insights into the relationships between bias, representation, and performance. Here's a plan for implementing and interpreting these experiments:

---

### **1. Adding Standard Bias to ReLU2**
- **Goal**: Test whether adding bias to the second linear layer in ReLU2 mitigates its catastrophic failure by allowing for better handling of dead nodes and offsetting the disjunctive intensity challenge.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - If bias alleviates ReLU2’s issues, we should see an improvement in accuracy, though it may still underperform ReLU2-Neg due to the lack of explicit distance conversion.
  - If it doesn’t help, it reinforces that the failure is rooted more deeply in the disjunctive intensity framework rather than bias absence.

---

### **2. Point-Slope Bias for Abs2-Neg**
- **Goal**: Validate whether a point-slope bias form improves Abs2-Neg’s ability to position the target digit at zero distance while preserving separation from other classes.
- **Method**:
  - Replace \( y = Wx + b \) with \( y = W(x - x_0) \), where \( x_0 \) is the centroid or mean of the target class for the given feature.
  - Use a learned \( x_0 \) for each feature as part of the model’s parameters.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - This could resolve Abs2-Neg’s issues with separating target and non-target classes, potentially resulting in its outperforming all other models.
  - The clustering and separation in feature space may be sharper due to alignment with statistical distance principles.

---

### **3. Point-Slope Bias for ReLU2**
- **Goal**: Explore whether point-slope bias allows ReLU2 to avoid dead nodes by improving its handling of features close to zero.
- **Expected Outcome**:
  - If effective, this modification could help ReLU2 recover some expressivity by reducing the risk of dead nodes. However, it may not fully resolve the issues since the disjunctive intensity mechanism is still in place.

---

### **Experiment Design**
#### **Models to Train**
1. **ReLU2 + Standard Bias**: Add bias to the second linear layer.
2. **Abs2-Neg + Point-Slope Bias**: Implement point-slope bias form.
3. **ReLU2 + Point-Slope Bias**: Implement point-slope bias form.

#### **Metrics**
- Test accuracy and variability across runs.
- Node activity statistics (e.g., percentage of dead nodes).
- Feature-space visualizations for Abs2-Neg with point-slope bias (projecting MNIST data onto Gaussian components).

---

### **Analysis**
1. **ReLU2 + Standard Bias**:
   - If this model still fails, it confirms that the bias absence was not the root cause and underscores the role of the disjunctive intensity challenge.
2. **Abs2-Neg + Point-Slope Bias**:
   - Plot class distributions for the MNIST data projected onto Gaussian components.
   - Visualize how the bias adjusts feature space and class separation.
   - Compare test accuracy and variance against other models.
3. **ReLU2 + Point-Slope Bias**:
   - Compare node activity statistics and accuracy against standard ReLU2 and ReLU2-Neg.

---

### **Implementation Details**
1. **Model Adjustments**:
   - Update the linear layer in Abs2-Neg and ReLU2 to incorporate point-slope bias.
   - Add standard bias to ReLU2 for the first experiment.

2. **Training Setup**:
   - Use the same training regimen (5000 epochs, full-batch SGD) for consistency.
   - Train each model for 20 runs to ensure statistical robustness.

3. **Visualization**:
   - For Abs2-Neg + Point-Slope Bias, project MNIST data onto the Gaussian component for key nodes and plot the distributions.
