Introduction: Brief overview of the paper including basis results and impact. Someone should be able to read this and get a high level picture of the impact.
Prior Work: I usually write this last. It is historical context informed by the actual paper contents. I try to telll a story that motivates the theory I am testing. “Why are we doing this?”
Background: Covers the theoretical framework and all information needed to understand the experiment. A deep dive into relevant prior work that leads to the theory we are testing. “What are we doing?”
Experimental Design: The experiments we are doing and why they are designed that way. “How are we doing this?
Experimental Results: The results of the experiments and how they support or refute our theory. “What happened when we did this?”
Discussion: Discussion of the results. Deeper analysis to connect to the theory. Speculative ideas that may motivate future work. “What does this all mean?”
Conclusion: A summary of results and impact.
