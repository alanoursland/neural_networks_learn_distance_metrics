I think this is going to be what my discussion has:


1. Acknowledge the violation of my prediction and the confusing results. State an intention to understand them. 

2. Show how projecting the data onto the hyperplane normal creates a 1d number line of class clusters at different distance with one centered at zero (for Abs) or several classes below zero for Relu. Talk about how the hyperplane can be placed anywhere on this line. Say maybe the lack of bias causes a problem. Show the results with bias and how they are slightly better but basically the same. 

3. Talk about ReLU2. Show dead node analysis. Present theory for disjunctive distance metrics to create intensity metrics. Show how all of the classes in the number line are moved below zero unless the target is at the high end of the cluster sequence. ReLU2-Neg only puts 10% of the points by the decision boundary so it doesn't go dead as easily. Mention that Abs doesn't have this problem because it folds the negative values back to the positive side. 

4. Talk about Abs2-Neg. It is learning a conjunctive distance representation. We expected it to do better. Why is it doing worse? Explain how the number line clusters could be shifted to place the target cluster at zero for each output node. That set of shifts defines one point in the latent space that is optimal for recognizing the class. The linear layer only has one point to learn. But each 129 degree linear output node can intersect 129 specific points. It probably intersects that point but then is forced to intersect other points that generate false positives. Show analysis supporting this. Abs2 on the other hand is learning a disjunctive distance. It is collecting everything that is not the target. It can select any number of points far from the target class on each latent node. That gives it a huge selection of points to select. It can select 129 points that don't intersect the target cluster. Verify that with analysis. 


5. Imagine a better output layer for Abs2-Neg. It would have an offset for each latent node to define the optimal point for a class. Then it would calculate the distance to that class. y = sqrt((x-x_c)^2). Add scaling to discount nodes. y = sqrt((a(x-x_c))^2). We trained ReLU-L2, Abs-L2, ReLU-L2-Neg, and Abs-L2-Neg. Present those results. Notice that they all do better than ReLU which was the previous best. Speculate that x_c can also select not-targets and effectively cover the disjunctive state. 


6. Conclusion summarizes everything.



Feedback:


1. Acknowledging Violations and Confusions
Prediction Violations: Reiterate that the theory expected Abs2-Neg to outperform, given its design to align with a conjunctive distance metric, yet it underperformed compared to Abs2. Similarly, ReLU2 catastrophically failed under intensity constraints, but ReLU2-Neg demonstrated recovery through negative transformations.
Confusions and Questions: Why did Abs2 perform well even under intensity constraints? Why does Abs2-Neg fall short despite the supposed alignment with distance metrics?
Intention: Express a commitment to uncover these discrepancies, forming the basis for revisiting theoretical assumptions.
2. 1D Number Line Projections
Cluster Formation: Describe how projecting data onto the hyperplane normal generates a 1D number line with clusters. For Abs, this is centered around zero; for ReLU, clusters fall into the positive range, with dead nodes representing points pushed out of the active range​interpret_nn_through_md​analyze_dead_nodes​failure_theories.
Bias and Placement: Discuss how bias could allow for more flexible alignment of these clusters but also why removing bias reveals intrinsic representational tendencies​bias_removal​paper_template.
Empirical Results: Present the results comparing biased vs. unbiased layers, noting the marginal improvement but overall similarity.
3. ReLU2 and Disjunctive Distance Metrics
Dead Node Analysis: Use dead node statistics to explain ReLU2's failure, connecting it to the saturation of features due to double ReLU activations​analyze_dead_nodes​failure_theories.
Conjunctive vs. Disjunctive Representations: Explain how ReLU2-Neg's transformation (via Neg) mitigates dead nodes and repositions class clusters effectively, yielding better accuracy​results_summary​failure_theories.
Abs as a Counterpoint: Highlight how Abs avoids these issues by folding negatives to positives, inherently preserving activation expressivity.
4. Abs2-Neg and Conjunctive Distance Failures
Abs and Clustering: Discuss why Abs2 should have been effective for conjunctive distance representation, with the folding behavior aligning clusters close to zero​experiment_purpose_and_…​overview.
Latent Space Shifts: Present a theory for why the linear output layer struggles to optimally position clusters without biases, leading to false positives due to intersecting decision boundaries​interpret_nn_through_md​paper_template.
Analysis: Support these points with data from node activation and performance analyses across 20 runs, emphasizing the variability in Abs2-Neg's performance​analysis_report​results_summary.
5. A Hypothetical Better Layer for Abs2-Neg
Optimal Representation: Hypothesize an improved architecture where offsets for each latent node align clusters optimally for each class​experiment_purpose_and_…​failure_theories.
Scaling Factor: Suggest incorporating a scaling mechanism into the offset computation to selectively discount less relevant nodes while focusing on high-impact clusters.
Empirical Verification: Show performance data for Abs-L2 and ReLU-L2 models as steps toward this ideal, noting their superiority over baseline ReLU​analysis_report​results_summary.
6. Conclusion
Summary of Findings: Recap that ReLU2-Neg validated distance metric dominance under constraints, but Abs2-Neg exposed unexpected complexity.
Broader Implications: Suggest these findings necessitate rethinking assumptions about how networks learn and leverage statistical distances.
Future Work: Propose studies on larger datasets and architectures to generalize findings, and explore hybrid activation functions or output layers to mitigate identified limitations​paper_template​paper_outline.
