Abstract: Summarize the entire narrative.

Given the importance of maintaining a cohesive narrative and aligning the sections, I’d recommend the following rewrite order to efficiently build the paper while ensuring each section informs the next:

---

### **1. Introduction**
   - **Why First**: The introduction sets the tone for the entire paper, and it’s critical to establish the focus on interpretability, the tension between distance and intensity representations, and the theoretical nature of the work. Including foreshadowing for OffsetL2 helps structure the rest of the paper.
   - **Goal**: Nail down the core narrative and provide clear framing for the contributions.

---

### **2. Background**
   - **Why Second**: The background lays the theoretical groundwork for the distance vs. intensity dichotomy, Mahalanobis distance, hyperplane geometry, and other foundational concepts. This section will guide both the experiments and the analysis.
   - **Goal**: Establish the framework that will anchor the experiments and analysis, ensuring clarity on key concepts like hyperplane intersections and statistical metrics.

---

### **3. Experimental Design**
   - **Why Third**: Once the theoretical framework is set, the experiments need to be defined as the practical tests of the framework. Writing this next allows you to structure the empirical exploration based on the theoretical foundations.
   - **Goal**: Ensure the experiments are tightly aligned with the theoretical narrative, setting up ReLU2 failure, Abs2-Neg, and the need for OffsetL2.

---

### **4. Results and Analysis**
   - **Why Fourth**: After defining the experiments, their results can be written, focusing on how they connect to the theoretical framework. This section should progressively build the narrative toward OffsetL2.
   - **Goal**: Highlight the insights into ReLU2’s failure, hyperplane intersections, and Abs2-Neg’s behavior, setting the stage for the OffsetL2 discussion.

---

### **5. Discussion**
   - **Why Fifth**: The discussion integrates the theoretical and empirical insights, providing a bridge to the OffsetL2 result. By writing this after results, you can ensure a seamless flow from analysis to conclusions.
   - **Goal**: Synthesize the findings, emphasize the implications for interpretability, and foreshadow OffsetL2 as the logical next step.

---

### **6. Conclusion**
   - **Why Sixth**: The conclusion wraps up the paper with OffsetL2 as the validating result, tying back to the theoretical framework and pointing toward future work. Writing this last ensures it fully reflects the preceding sections.
   - **Goal**: Deliver a satisfying conclusion, emphasizing OffsetL2’s significance without overstating it, and set up your next paper.

---

### **7. Abstract**
   - **Why Last**: The abstract summarizes the entire paper, so it’s best written after all sections are complete. This allows you to concisely capture the narrative and contributions based on the fully developed content.
   - **Goal**: Provide a compelling and focused summary that highlights the interpretability framework, key insights, and OffsetL2’s role as a validating result.
